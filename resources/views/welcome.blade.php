Font Awesome is a popular icon library that provides scalable vector icons that can be customized (size, color, drop shadow, etc.) with CSS. If you see "font-awesome" in the inspect element, it likely means that the icons on the page are being served from Font Awesome and are being styled with CSS.</p>
